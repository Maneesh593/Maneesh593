## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maneesh and I _love_ coding. Here are some things you should know that I think are true or you should know about me.

1. Ruby > Python (_it just is_)
2. Kotlin > Java (_null safety, concise syntax, etc_)
3. Lua = G.O.A.T!!!!!! (_easier than Python because it has less keywords, faster than Python because it is based on C_)
4. Flutter > React or Electron (_React/electron use Chromium+Nodejs, which is heavy and clunky, but Flutter compiles to native code_)
5. CSS > JavaScript (_but only in styling. use JS to apply CSS_)
6. I know 3 languages and the basics of many others

I love to play videogames and I love making them. Although I am too embarassed to share them on a repository. Let me know if you want to see them.
I like to upload random things I make onto github.

Want me to make something? As long as it is reasonable I will probably make it.
My game "company" is Studio Palindrome at maneesh593.github.io/studiopalindrome.github.io
Am currently working on a platformer game called Chilakapalli with my friends
